# AI RAG Lab – From Scratch to Real-Time AI Assistant

This repository documents my journey of learning and building **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems from scratch and progressing toward real-world AI applications using **LangChain, Vector Databases, and LLMs**.

The goal is not to copy tutorials, but to deeply understand how RAG works internally and apply it to build practical AI systems.

## Learning Roadmap

This repo is structured as a progressive journey through four connected AI projects:

### 🔹 Project 1 — RAG From Scratch (No LangChain)
Understand RAG at the fundamental level using:
- Embeddings
- Vector search (FAISS)
- Chunking
- Context injection into LLM

> Build RAG using pure Python + OpenAI + FAISS.

---

### 🔹 Project 2 — Multi-Document RAG with LangChain
Introduce LangChain after understanding RAG basics:
- Document loaders
- Text splitters
- Vector stores
- Chains and prompts

> Build a RAG system that works across multiple documents.

---

### 🔹 Project 3 — Personal AI Data Analyst
Combine RAG with data analysis:
- Upload CSV
- Ask questions
- AI analyzes data using Pandas + LLM reasoning

> Build an AI assistant that acts like a data analyst.

---

### 🔹 Project 4 — Real-Time AI Assistant (Streamlit App)
Turn everything into an interactive application:
- Ask questions from documents/data in real-time
- Deploy as a usable AI tool

> Build a complete AI application.
